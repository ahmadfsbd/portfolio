# Photography

_A gallery of my favorite photography work._

Capturing moments through the lens has always been one of my greatest joys. Photography gives me a way to **pause time**, frame the beauty of the world, and share unique stories without words.

## Wildlife Photography
Wildlife holds a special place in my heart. Patience, quiet observation, and a respect for nature are at the core of my approach. I spend hours tracking birds and animals to capture their **raw, authentic behaviors** in their natural habitats.

Photography isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s a way of seeing the world.  
Each image reflects a story of patience, curiosity, and a deep appreciation for the beauty that surrounds us.
