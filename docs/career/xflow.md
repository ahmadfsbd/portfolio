# xFlow Research  
_2018 – 2022_  

It all started here—my first deep dive into the world of **cloud engineering** and **network virtualization**.  
xFlow Research was more than a job; it was my launchpad into cutting-edge telecom and cloud technologies.

## My Role  
**Cloud & NFV Engineer → Team Lead**  
I began as a hands-on engineer, building and automating network-function virtualization (NFV) solutions, and eventually led a talented team of developers and QA engineers.

### Key Highlights
**NFV Innovation**  
  > * Led **R&D for a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)** solution powered by **Vector Packet Processing (VPP)**.  
  > * Delivered **Edge Distributed Compute Node (DCN)** stacks within OpenStack, including the **Dell EMC Ready OpenStack (JetStream 16.x)** solution.

**Automation at Scale**  
  > * Built Python-based automation for **Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)** nodes with NFV acceleration.  
  > * Integrated technologies like **OVS hardware offload, SR-IOV, OVS-DPDK, NUMA pinning, DPDK, and HugePages** for lightning-fast data paths.

**Leadership & Mentorship**  
  > * Planned QA test cases and drove test automation.  
  > * Guided the team’s technical direction, ensuring timely and high-quality deliveries.  
  > * Mentored junior engineers—passing on the same spirit of curiosity that sparked my own career.

## Tech Playground  
I honed skills that became the foundation of my career:

* **Cloud Platforms**: OpenStack (Red Hat & community), OpenShift
* **Automation**: Python, Ansible, Terraform  
* **Networking**: High-performance packet processing with DPDK and VPP  
* **Containers**: Early adoption of Kubernetes and Docker for Telco solutions

## What I Took Away  
xFlow was my **innovation lab**—where I learned that **automation is freedom**, and where I discovered the excitement of blending open-source technologies with real-world telecom challenges.

It wasn’t just a job; it was where I became a **problem-solver, mentor, and future DevOps engineer**—skills I now carry into every role.
