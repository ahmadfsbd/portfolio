# Canonical  
_2022 – 2024_

Joining **Canonical**, the company behind Ubuntu, felt like stepping onto the global open-source stage. Here I refined my skills in **cloud automation, large-scale deployments, and open-source collaboration**—all while working with some of the brightest engineers in the industry.

## Role  
**Field Software Engineer (Cloud & DevOps)**  

I was responsible for delivering **end-to-end Telco Cloud projects**—from the first customer conversation to production hand-over. This meant not only writing code and automating infrastructure, but also engaging with customers on **RFX/RFI**, preparing **Statements of Work (SOWs)**, and supporting **pre-sales** activities.

### Key Highlights
**End-to-End Project Delivery**  
  > * Led design, architecture, and implementation for complex multi-site cloud environments.  
  > * Coordinated timelines, QA, and stakeholder communication to ensure on-time, high-quality delivery.

**Pre-Sales & Customer Engagement**  
  > * Participated in **RFX/RFI** processes, translating customer requirements into actionable proposals.  
  > * Drafted detailed **SOWs** and presented technical solutions to both business and technical audiences.

**Cloud Architecture & Automation**  
  > * Designed aggregated, disaggregated, and **hyper-converged cloud platforms** using the **Charmed Framework**.  
  > * Automated **NFVI deployments** with **Terraform providers for Juju and MAAS**, reducing delivery times and manual errors.

  > * Implemented **offline repositories** for air-gapped cloud deployments—ensuring updates and security compliance without internet access.

**Monitoring & Security**  
  > * Deployed **Prometheus, Grafana, Grafana Agent, NRPE, and Alertmanager** for full-stack observability.  
  > * Secured deployments with **Ubuntu Security Guide (USG)** to meet **CIS benchmarks**.

**Open Source Engagement**
