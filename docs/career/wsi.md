# Wellcome Sanger Institute  
_2024 ‚Äì Present_

Joining the **Wellcome Sanger Institute** opened a new chapter in my career‚Äîworking at the intersection of **cloud engineering** and **world-class genomics research**. Here, I design and maintain **high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructures** that power cutting-edge scientific discoveries.

## Role  
**Senior Cloud and Platform Engineer**

I lead and support the automation, scalability, and security of Sanger‚Äôs cloud and hybrid infrastructure. This means **designing resilient systems**, enabling **rapid scientific workflows**, and ensuring **research data integrity** at massive scale.

### Key Highlights
**Infrastructure Modernization & Automation**  
  > * Architected and automated **multi-cluster Kubernetes** and **OpenStack** deployments for compute-intensive genomics workloads.  
  > * Implemented **Infrastructure as Code** using **Terraform** and **Ansible** to create repeatable, auditable deployments.

**Cloud & HPC Integration**  
  > * Built workflows to bridge on-premise HPC with cloud bursting, ensuring seamless scalability for high-demand projects.

**Security & Compliance**  
  > * Enforced CIS-aligned standards and continuous monitoring to protect sensitive genomic data.

**Collaboration & Support**  
  > * Partnered with researchers, bioinformaticians, and data engineers to accelerate analysis pipelines and reduce time-to-discovery.
